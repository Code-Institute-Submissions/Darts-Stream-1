# Darts-Stream-1

I created a dart website for my stream 1 project.

Using a bootstrap template, I used a bootstrap carousel on the home page to display different darts videos.

The setup and rules pages display show darts information while useing fade in elements.

The practice routines pages highlight different routines in addition to some youtube videos .

The games page just displays some different darts games with a few images abovd them.

Using a bootstrap modal and jquery, the finishes page allows users to unput different finishes, and they will be displayed to the screen. There is also a table on the page for another lookup method.

The score pages allows users to calculate their scores and will be displayed to the screen. I used javascript to calculate the remaining scores and output them to the screen.

The calender page is just a simple table showing all the televised darts events throughout the year.

Finally The contact page allows the user to contact the site if they have any suggestions on how the site can be improved. There is also links to twitter pages of some of the worlds best darts players.
